Hmm... I think the people are unhappy with this decision...
According to John Smith's report, we won't make enough ducats this month to fund that new bridge. What a shame.
Perhaps we should raise levies, I think the barbarians to the north are preparing an invasion.
We should focus on the Grain Dole, feeding the people is necessary.
Long live our king!
We should raise war taxes to pay for that...
Our glorious realm shall prevail!
Those damned infidels... We ought to declare war! Deus vult!
Our subjects will just have to live with these new taxes.
We need a bard to lighten the mood in this building...
All these Whigs don't understand... All us Tories want is what's best for the country!
Our King's word should be absolute!
Perhaps we can appease both the Nobles and the Clergy with this arrangement.
